# Paused checkpoint: 2026-10-13

Hari requested a pause and a private GitHub checkpoint. The persistent goal is paused. All workers stopped. Do not resume implementation, live audio or administrator actions until Hari asks.

## Completed implementation

- Native macOS desktop library: finalized WAV import, playback, search, transcript export/delete, appearance and model-file validation.
- Explicit selected-WAV on-device Apple Speech adapter, with no cloud fallback.
- Independent RNNoise microphone/speaker processing and private audio routing helper.
- Independent virtual audio driver, timestamped transport and synthetic HAL test tools.
- App-route mute/gain controls, recording with pause/resume, finalized WAV history save and retained failure files.
- Floating control widget with shared route/recording state.
- Temporary selected-microphone Original/RNNoise comparison, explicit playback, replay, cancellation and cleanup.
- REA feature ledger assigning all 1,014 current catalog keys across 32 families: 22 retained, 6 unresolved, 4 excluded. These counts are scope assignments, not completion percentages.

No trial, subscription or payment gate exists in the independent implementation. Cloud services and analytics are excluded. Full feature, visual and audio parity has not been achieved.

## Verification

The last combined `./verify` completed with exit 0 across all ten component suites, including 46 desktop tests. Release, ASan/UBSan, synthetic helper pipe integration, ARM64/macOS 12 packaging, signatures and relocated-resource checks passed. No real microphone capture or audible playback ran. Earlier REA observations verified limited desktop appearance and navigation, not the newly added widget or comparison UI.

The private local log is `evidence/combined-verify-microphone-test.log`, SHA256 `19fefe223e9e5e34d3e06747b60217750474592f446ebe0dd324f84f4d1b4e34`. It is excluded from Git. The feature ledger records 43 implementation source fingerprints checked at this checkpoint.

## Exact Mac state

The diagnostic independent driver is installed at `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL/LabVoiceAudio.driver`. Its signed file-tree SHA256 is `5ca286e9483c605f82ecdfabeb830fd640dd5cd534eef3f390a4bef0b98dea95`. CoreAudio PID 94316 started at 10:27:21 Asia/Kolkata, before the diagnostic replacement. The final restart did not run. Diagnostic-driver loading is unverified. Earlier normal builds registered the plug-in but published no devices; the class-qualifier fix did not resolve that. No live route has run.

Do not reinstall just to restart. After Hari resumes and is available for administrator approval, follow `app/audio-driver/install-notes.md`: revalidate the installed tree, restart once, run the read-only discovery probe and inspect actual service traces. Only if exact endpoints are usable, proceed with the previously approved bounded synthetic HAL test and live routing plan. Otherwise diagnose or use the exact-match rollback. Private rollback script: `evidence/remove-trace-driver.py`. Never rely on stale PIDs.

## Next implementation step

Local library folder selection was planned only. No implementation or tests were changed for it. Read `storage-location-findings.md`. Proposed work is a persisted folder choice, strict reopen without silent fallback, shared busy admission, selected-root recording saves and protection from stale async results. Existing-data migration semantics are unknown; do not silently move/delete prior sessions.

## Remaining major work

- Resolve driver discovery and verify real microphone/speaker routing, cleanup, timing and audio quality.
- Verify and integrate installed original-model inference locally. Current catalog validation is not inference.
- Accent conversion, background-voice isolation, AEC, live ASR/captions, speaker labels and other retained features remain incomplete.
- Complete storage selection, activation, lifecycle, diagnostics, notification and widget workflows from the feature ledger.
- Complete original-versus-rebuild interaction and audio comparisons. Do not infer parity from passing synthetic tests.

## Repository and local files

Private repository: https://github.com/Mr-Neutr0n/openkrisp

The source remains at `/Users/harikp/Developer/solo/reverse-engineering-lab/projects/krisp`; it is now its own Git repository without moving files. Build from its root with `./verify`. Requires macOS and Xcode command-line tools. The ad-hoc app output is `app/desktop/.build/app/Lab Voice.app`.

Raw REA evidence, original binaries/models/assets, generated audio, build outputs and analysis runtime are excluded. RNNoise source and its included model are included with upstream notices. Original Krisp weight redistribution terms are unresolved. Some historical evidence references and fingerprint keys use the enclosing lab-relative `projects/krisp/` prefix. These are provenance paths, not required checkout locations.

Use this file with `feature-parity-ledger.md`, `PLAN.md` and the component README files to resume. Historical PLAN entries describe previous states; this checkpoint is the current pause state.
